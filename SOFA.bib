	where a dense mesh of 60-70 points on the face is used, such as an
	active appearance model ({AAM}). {H}owever, for applications where
	manually labeling frames is prohibitive, {AAM}s do not work well
	as they do not generalize well to unseen subjects. {A}s such, a more
	coarse approach is taken for person-independent facial expression
	detection, where just a couple of key features (such as face and
	eyes) are tracked using a {V}iola-{J}ones type approach. {T}he tracked
	image is normally post-processed to encode for shift and illumination
	invariance using a linear bank of filters. {R}ecently, it was shown
	that this preprocessing step is of no benefit when close to ideal
	registration has been obtained. {I}n this paper, we present a system
	based on the {C}onstrained {L}ocal {M}odel ({CLM}) which is a generic

	{R}ecognizing spontaneous facial actions, however, is very challenging

	current research in facial expression recognition is limited to posed

	probabilistic inference by systematically integrating visual measurements

  abstract = {{A}utomatic facial image analysis has been a long standing research
	problem in computer vision. {A} key component in facial image analysis,
	largely conditioning the success of subsequent algorithms (e.g. facial
	expression recognition), is to define a vocabulary of possible dynamic
	facial events. {T}o date, that vocabulary has come from the anatomically-based
	{F}acial {A}ction {C}oding {S}ystem ({FACS}) or more subjective approaches
	(i.e. emotion-specified expressions). {T}he aim of this paper is
	to discover facial events directly from video of naturally occurring
	facial behavior, without recourse to {FACS} or other labeling schemes.
	{T}o discover facial events, we propose a temporal clustering algorithm,
	{A}ligned {C}luster {A}nalysis ({ACA}), and a multi-subject correspondence
	algorithm for matching expressions. {W}e use a variety of video sources:
	posed facial behavior ({C}ohn-{K}anade database), unscripted facial
	behavior ({RU}-{FACS} database) and some video in infants. {A}ccuracy
	of (unsupervised) {ACA} approached that of a supervised version,
	achieved moderate intersystem agreement with {FACS}, and proved informative
